The Module is built from scratch using numpy.
Current completed algorithms that can be utilized are
1. Neural Network
2. Decision Tree
3. Regression 

There are examples and demos created with jupyter notebook to  showcase its use.
There are also a couple of projects completed using the module to serve as the machine learning model.
