### Kaerebrum - Machine Learning Module build with python using numpy

The Module is built from scratch using numpy.

There are examples and demos created with jupyter notebook to  showcase its use.
There are also a couple of projects completed using the module to serve as the machine learning model.

Current completed algorithms that can be utilized are
1. Neural Network
    - [Demo with Augemented Mnist](https://github.com/Kaelancode/Kaerebrum-Public/blob/main/Augment%20Mnist%20with%20Kaerebrum.ipynbm/)
3. Decision Tree
4. Regression
